# C# Project Euler Solutions


I created this repository to solve [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net) problems in C# ( C# .NET framework ) to demonstrate math and algorithm in a high level programming language ( 3GL ). 
## Getting Started

Run `git clone` command to get you a copy of the project on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

* [.NET Core SDK 2.0 or later](https://www.microsoft.com/net/download/windows)
* [Git command line client](https://www.git-scm.com/)
* Text Editor

### Installing
* After running `git clone` and installing all prequisites you are ready to run the console application or each problem individually to see the answer.

### Running
* Run the application from the source code with `dotnet run` command in Command Prompt, without or with an argument which is the [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/archives) problem number.
For example: `dotnet run 3` will display the answer for problem # 3. 
`dotnet run` will ask  for a problem number.
## Built With
* .NET Core SDK and `dotnet new console -lang C# -f netcoreapp2.0`  
* Visual Studio Code or any other text editor such as [ATOM](https://atom.io/)
* Solutions folder:  each problem has a C# file

## Solutions
- [Problem 1: ](./Solutions/Problem_1.cs)Multiples of 3 and 5
- [Problem 2: ](./Solutions/Problem_2.cs)Even Fibonacci numbers
- [Problem 3: ](./Solutions/Problem_3.cs)Largest prime factor
- [Problem 4: ](./Solutions/Problem_4.cs)Largest palindrome product
- [Problem 5: ](./Solutions/Problem_5.cs)Smallest multiple :new:
- [Problem 6: ](./Solutions/Problem_6.cs)Sum square difference :new:
